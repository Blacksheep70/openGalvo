# Welcome to the openGalvo project

## openGalvo Shield Rev. 1.0

Intension was to develop a shield which provides enough possibilities to
develop hobby machines and applications for laser, e.g. SLA printer or laser etching.

### Features:

* Based on a Mega 2650
* 12 Bit DAC (4048 "steps")
* 4 Potentiometers for gain & offset
* DAC is easy to control by just setting the voltage on a channel (X/Y axis)
* Support for 3 endstops
* Pololu driver for Z-axis
* Connectors routed for all important pins
* JTAG debug connector to debug e.g. using ATMEL ICE
* Comes with small example code to draw an rectangle and drive the stepper motor
* Connector for the RAMPS 1.4 Display-Kit with 12864 LCD and Controller

### How to build

You can either use the Eagle files to create the PCP by yourself, send the Gerber files to your favorite PCB builder or order a PCB (naked, without parts or with soldered parts ready to use with your Mega 2560) from me. For ordering the PCB please visit my Page:
